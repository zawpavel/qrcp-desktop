# qrcp desktop  
**qrcp-desktop** is the GUI for [qrcp project](https://github.com/claudiodangelis/qrcp)  
it is build using [gio](https://github.com/gioui/gio)  
with this program you can send files from your computer to your smartphone and vice versa within the same LAN  
unlike the [qr-file-transfer](https://github.com/zawpavel/qr-file-transfer) project, there is a native file picker, but because of this feature the program **is only available for linux**  
this repo remains as an example of working with gio, for real file transfers prefer to use [qr-file-transfer](https://github.com/zawpavel/qr-file-transfer)
